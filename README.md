# Open Source Stepping Stones

## Introduction

Open Source is built on openness and freedom. It providies space for intrinsically motivated work and free distributon of its results. This reduces barriers. It allows peers to come together and realize their goals through open means. One of the powerful results are open source communities. They unlock new levels of collaboration and adoption which result in a new quality of success. Not every open source project intends to build a community but those who do and succeed have an invaluable asset at hand to foster their success.

How can you reach that success? There are two key factors: **Produce good code** and **Be accessible to users and contributors**. This is what makes a good upstream open source project, a project which creates value to its users, a project which attracts people to work on creating this value together.

There is a lot to be said about how to create good code which has value to its users and there are many places where you will find great information, advice and inspiration how this can be done. Here we will focus on how to make an open source project accessible to users and contributors. What are the stepping stones you need to build to give users and contributors a way to access the project, to use its results and be a part of it.

This is a work in progress. There are many stepping stones you can identify and we expect the collection to grow and become more detailed over time. It will never be an exhaustive list of everything possible, but we hope that this collection can be useful as a source for people to pick what resonates with them and build there own interpretation which suits their projects.

To give some orientation we group the stepping stones in eight paths which look at accessing open source projects from four different angles, Each stepping stone comes with a description and some examples and stories from real projects which illustrate the idea. Here we also very much welcome your input. You do know more examples and stories. Please don't hesitate to contribute them so that others can learn and be inspired from what you have learned and already figured out.

## The eight paths of open source success

* [*Motivation*](motivation.md) - What attracts people to the project? What is the intrinsic motivation to be a part?
* [*Home*](home.md) - What is the identiy of the project? How can people feel at home there?
* [*Transparency*](transparency.md) - How to realize the benefits of being open? How to be welcoming, reliable, and predictable?
* [*Adoption*](adoption.md) - How to reach users and grow their base?
* [*Development*](development.md) - What are development practices which foster quality, trust, and fun?
* [*Governance*](governance.md) - Which structures are needed to support the project?
* [*Onboarding*](onboarding.md) - How do people get into the project?
* [*Sustainability*](sustainability.md) - What is the long-term perspective to maintain the project? Where does funding come from?

## The big picture

The eight paths form four angles from which to access an open source project. Together they build the complete picture of stepping stones.

[TODO: Insert an image here]

There are four angles:

* The emotional angle: Motivation and Home
* The angle of accessibility: Transparency and Adoption
* The structural angle: Development and Governance
* The economical angle: Onboarding and Sustainability
