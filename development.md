# Development

Heart of any open source project is development (in a broad sense, covering programming, but also all other parts which are necessary to create good software, design, documentation, etc.). That's the creative, the productive part. Doing it in a way which is accessible to others is a challenge with amazing benefits if solved in a good way.

The following stepping stones form the path of development. They are not in a specific order. Each project will pick and arrange them in a way that is suitable to them.

## Code Review

A technical need during development with a social benefit.


## Tests

Set expectations, also in code.


## Automate away controversies

E.g. coding style through tools.


## Trustful releases

Create them transparently, document them properly, be reliable and predictable, sign them.


## Conscious dependencies

Be conscious and explicit about your dependencies so that you know with whom you have to work and your users know what to expect and what to watch out for.


## Standard procedures

It's easier if people can apply what they already know, e.g. following standard git work flows.


## Standard interfaces and formats

Power is in combination of projects and components with dedicated purposes. Use open standards to make it composable. To foster collaboration. To make it easy to share and remix.


## Simplify your build

Building software can be one of the biggest obstacles to contributions. Make it simple. Document it well.
