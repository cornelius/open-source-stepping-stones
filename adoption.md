# Adoption

Most of the paths are leaning towards the people who contribute and how to make the project accessible for them. But ultimately what would be an open source project without its users. This path focuses on them, making the project accessible for users. This is the path of adoption. It can be a powerful leverage for all other paths.

The following stepping stones form the path of adoption. They are not in a specific order. Each project will pick and arrange them in a way that is suitable to them.


## Support your users

Help them, be approachable, give them support. Enable them to help other users.


## Documentation

Make sure users can find their way without having to ask you.


## Packaging

Consumption of software can be tricky. Make it as simple as possible. Package your software properly so people can trust it and can use it without jumping through hoops.


## Professional support

Some users, especially companies, will need more formal support so they can use your software in production environments with all the requirements that brings.


## User voice

Give your users a voice, channel that to the people who can act on it. Have user seats on your boards. Have advisory groups. Read what is coming in through issue trackers etc.


## Communicate

Let users know what's going on. Write newsletters. Let your people write blogs. Aggregate them.


## Set Expectations

Be clear about your audience. Define expectations on what you deliver and what not.
